Here are several ways in which parliamentarians may engage in corrupt practices, harming legal and ethical norms:
1.Distribution of Officials and Investments: Parliamentarians might use their position to influence the allocation of state funds or projects, seeking financial benefits or support for interested parties.

2.Legislative Changes for Compensation: Parliamentarians may receive compensation or other benefits in exchange for modifying laws or regulations that favor specific companies or interested parties.

3.Attempts to Buy Political Influence: Parliamentarians might offer financial or other rewards to colleagues or party members to gain support or favor.

4.False Declarations and Concealment: Parliamentarians may hide their income or assets, or falsify financial disclosures, to make it harder to prove financial gain or corrupt transactions.

5.Abuse of Official Position: Parliamentarians might misuse their office through illegal or unethical means, such as directing state contracts or manipulating tenders.

6.Accepting Bribes: Parliamentarians could accept bribes or rewards to make certain political or practical decisions or perform specific actions.

7.Threats and Coercion: Parliamentarians might threaten or coerce others to influence their decisions or actions.

8.Illegal Financial Support: Parliamentarians may receive fake grants or financial support that are part of corrupt deals.

These actions can lead to the formation of an inappropriate political environment, loss of public trust, and misuse of state resources.
