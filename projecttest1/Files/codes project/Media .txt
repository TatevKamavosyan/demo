Corruption in the Media (Mass Media) can manifest in the following ways:
1.Business Agreements: Media outlets may receive corrupt payments or other rewards from authorities or private companies to present or withhold certain information.

2.Report Manipulation: Media outlets might facilitate the spread of false information due to financial interests or the influence of powerful individuals. This can include data manipulation or covering up certain events.

3.Interview and Publication Bias: Media outlets may collaborate with corrupt entities or individuals to select or distort data and stories, diverting public attention from important issues.

4.Contract and Deal Corruption: Media outlets might sign contracts with various companies or organizations that have vested interests in promoting or suppressing certain information.

5.Threats or Pressures: Media personnel may be threatened or pressured to withhold or alter information to protect corrupt interests.

6.Traditional Benefactors: In the context of corrupt dealings and interests, media outlets might receive financial support or donations from benefactors that influence how information is presented.

These phenomena undermine the credibility of the media and the free flow of critical information to the public.
